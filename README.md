# Diabetes-prediction <br>
Diabetes is a metabolic disease that results in highblood  sugar  in  the  blood  stream  having  severe  circumstances.Recently,  the  number  of  patients  is  increasing  at  an  alarmingrate.   The   increased   number   of   patients   poses   an   alarmingsituation. The early prediction of diabetes could be instrumentalin better treatment and lowering   death   rate.   The   rapidadvancements  in  the  machine  learning  is  playing  crucial  role  inhealthcare by predicting the outcome of diseases and pandemics.In  this  study,  we  used  Logistic  Regression,  Random  Forest,Naive  Bayes  and  Decision  Tree  classifier  to  predict  diabetes.The  dataset  that  we  are  using  is  PIMA  Indian  Diabetes  datasetfor  this  purpose.  We  have  generated  a  classification  report  toexamine   the   model.   The   experimental   results   demonstratedthat  prediction  with  Random  forest  could  reach  the  highestaccuracy  of  94%  whereas  the  accuracy  for  Logistic  Regressionwas 79%, Decision tree was 87% and for Niave Bayes it was 80%.
